- What's the difference between the SDK and the CLI?



- `&ENABLE_WEB3`

- parcels in scene.json

- external libraries

- objects shown red on preview


- change material of gltf





**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

For a more details, follow the steps in the [Installation guide](https://docs.decentraland.org/documentation/installation-guide/).


**Previewing the scene**

Once you've installed the CLI, download this example and navigate to its directory from your terminal or command prompt.

_from the scene directory:_

```
$:  dcl start
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI will open the scene in a new browser tab automatically.
