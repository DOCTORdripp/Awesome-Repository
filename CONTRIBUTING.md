# How to contribute

We strongly encourage members of the community to help this repository grow and become more useful to everyone.

To propose a change, please submit a [new pull request](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/Awesome-Repository/pullse). Pull requests will be reviewed by someone in the Decentraland foundation before being merged and published.

## Examples

When posting an example, please help us keep this repository lightweight and only include the link to the example, not the entire code.

The code in the examples should be as clear and succinct as possible, and keep the main mechanics as docoupled as possible so that they can be easily read and reused by others. The example should aid others to understand a concept or mechanic, or provide reusable modules and abstractions.

We don't want to overwhelm readers with many examples that cover essentially the same topics, so we'd like to encourage posting examples that deal with novel ideas that other examples in this repo don't already cover.

Please try to adhere to the existing structure to keep content easy to find, adding it to the most relevant category, loosely ordered by difficulty & relevance within each category. Please provide a brief description and a screenshot or gif to help readers more easily glance through all examples.

## Tutorials

Linking to relevant tutorials is also encouraged. The content should be specific to Decentraland or relevant to content creators creating content for Decentraland.

Tutorials on any external platform are welcome. These should be all in English, to ensure they're readable by the majority of users.

## Libraries

Libraries that are available on `npm` are also encouraged to be shared here, as long as they contain useful abstractions for creating Decentraland content. Just include them on the table in the "libraries" section.

## Reporting issues

The `Issues` tab is meant to be used to voice questions or concerns and surface issues regarding these examples and the Decentraland SDK in general.

If you have an issue to report with one of the linked scenes in particular, please report it in this repository, clearly indicating which was the repository where the issue occured and what steps to take in order to reproduce this issue.
